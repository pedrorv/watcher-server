# watcher-server

watcher-server is a Node.js application designed to persist and retrieve events generated by a [watcher](https://github.com/pedrorv/watcher) script. It uses Express.js for server functionality and PostgreSQL for database operations. It's also used by a [watcher-dashboard](https://github.com/pedrorv/watcher-dashboard) to generate data visualizations from collected session events.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16
- PostgreSQL 11.8

### Installing

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Setting Up the Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root using the `.env.example` structure.

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with nodemon and ts-node, enabling hot reloading.

For production, first build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

### Running with Docker

This application can be easily run using Docker and Docker Compose. This ensures a consistent environment for development and testing. Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Run

1. Make sure you have installed the dependencies using the command `npm install` and the `.env` file is set up in the project root as described in the 'Setting Up the Environment' section of this README.

2. From the root directory of the project, execute the following command to build and start the server along with the PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command builds the `server` service based on `Dockerfile.dev` and starts the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

   - The `server` service runs in development mode, executing `npm i && npm run dev`.
   - The `postgres` service starts a PostgreSQL 11.8 server on Alpine Linux.
   - Ports, volumes, and environment variables are set as per the configuration in `docker-compose.yml`.

3. Once the services are up and running, the server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. However, this can vary depending on the PORT environment variable set in your `.env` file. Ensure to use the correct port as specified in your environment configuration.

4. To stop the Docker containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running. To remove the containers completely, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Scripts

- `start`: Run the built server.
- `dev`: Run the server in development mode with hot reloading.
- `build`: Build the project for production.
- `lint`: Lint the project files.
- `migrate`: Run database migrations.

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Source files.
- `/build`: Production build of the application.
- `/db/migrations`: Database migration files.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes several API endpoints:

- `GET /healthcheck`: Health check endpoint.
- `GET /authorized`: Check authorization.
- `GET /apps`: Fetch applications.
- `GET /sessions/:appId`: Get sessions for an app.
- `GET /events/:sessionId`: Get events for a session.
- `POST /events`: Add new events.
- `DELETE /events/:sessionId`: Delete events for a session.
